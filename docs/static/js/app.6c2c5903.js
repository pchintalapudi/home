The VM and bytecode are modeled loosely off the specifications of the JVM and CLR, minus multithreading-specific instructions.

It also takes heavy advantage of the localStorage API to cache class descriptions and store the user\'s schedule. Also, I brought back a feature from an older version of CourseRoad, namely prerequisite and corequisite links.

In fact, one of my most memorable experiences on this project was converting the function evaluator from running on 4 threads to running on a single thread and observing a 5X speedup, simply from the effects of cache thrashing and heavily improved branch prediction.
