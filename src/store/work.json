Within the team, I worked on multiple projects, including securing endpoints with Spring Security, creating an automation test suite to verify page loads and estimate page load times, and adding new functionality to the application by creating new endpoints to support data aggregation into a chart view. Besides the actual code though, I also learned many other aspects of robust production-level programming, such as Jira issue tracking, the SVN version control system, automation testing using Cypress, the Maven build system, and Jenkins continuous integration."

In support of this goal, I learned to make and pour agar plates and LB broth, culture bacterial and mammalian cells in a variety of environments, transfect and clone plasmids into mammalian and bacterial cells, and harvest DNA from bacteria for sequencing. From an assaying perspective, I learned the basics of flow cytometry and colony counting to assess antibacterial activity.",
